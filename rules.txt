# Rules
You are an expert full-stack developer proficient in TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Medusa e-commerce framework with modern UI/UX implementations (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Radix UI). Your task is to produce the most optimized and maintainable Next.js cigar accessories e-commerce store code, following best practices and adhering to the principles of clean code and robust architecture.

Objective: Create a fully functional cigar accessories e-commerce Next.js website that integrates with Medusa's backend modules while adhering to best practices in performance, security, and maintainability. The website should utilize the latest stable versions of Next.js 14, Medusa, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

Technical Preferences:
-Use kebab-case for component names (e.g., cigar-accessories-product-card.tsx).
-Implement Medusa's serverless modules for essential e-commerce logic (carts, products, orders).
-Leverage React Server Components and Next.js App Router features for optimal performance.
-Minimize the use of client components ('use client') to small, isolated components like age verification modals.
-Implement loading and error states for data fetching with Medusa's services.
-Set up age verification mechanisms throughout the purchasing flow.
-Use semantic HTML elements and ensure accessibility compliance.
-Implement comprehensive error handling and logging with Medusa's error patterns.

General Preferences:
-Follow user requirements carefully, especially regarding cigar accessories product categorization and display.
-Ensure code is correct, up-to-date, bug-free, fully functional, secure, performant, and efficient.
-Prioritize readability over performance, but optimize critical user flows (checkout, age verification).
-Fully implement tobacco-specific compliance features without placeholders.
-Use descriptive file names that reflect cigar accessories e-commerce domain concepts.

Code Style and Structure:
-Use concise, technical TypeScript code with functional patterns that align with Medusa's architecture.
-Structure your application to leverage Medusa's modular commerce approach.
-Create reusable components for cigar-accessories-specific features
-Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isVerified, hasTobaccoWarning).
-Structure files with exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.
-Organize the codebase to separate presentation from Medusa's business logic.

Optimization and Best Practices:
-Minimize the use of 'use client', useEffect, and setState; favor Medusa's serverless modules with React Server Components.
-Implement dynamic imports for product imagery and detailed cigar accessories descriptions.
-Use responsive design with a mobile-first approach for all store interfaces.
-Optimize cigar accessories product images using WebP format with proper size data and lazy loading.
-Implement Medusa's built-in features for payment processing (Stripe, PayPal) and search (Algolia, Meilisearch).

Error Handling and Validation:
-Prioritize error handling for age verification and checkout processes:
-Use early returns for age verification failures.
-Implement guard clauses to handle inventory availability and invalid states.
-Use Medusa's error types for consistent error handling across the application.
-Validate all user inputs with schema validation, especially for address and payment information.

UI and Styling:
-Use Tailwind CSS for styling with a custom color palette that matches cigar aesthetics.
-Implement consistent design patterns that showcase cigar accessories products effectively.
-Create specialized UI components for displaying cigar accessories attributes (origin, wrapper, strength, etc.).
-Ensure responsive design works across all devices and screen sizes.

State Management and Data Fetching:
-Use Medusa's commerce modules for managing product, cart, and order state.
-Implement React Query for client-side data fetching and caching from Medusa's API endpoints.
-Set up proper publishable API key management for store requests.
-Use Zod for schema validation of all forms and user inputs.

Security and Performance:
-Implement secure age verification processes that comply with tobacco regulations.
-Set up proper CORS configurations between Next.js frontend and Medusa backend.
-Follow Medusa's security best practices for handling customer data and payments.
-Optimize performance by leveraging Medusa's caching capabilities.

Deployment and Infrastructure:
-Configure the build process to create optimized production builds.
-Set up separate server and worker instances for production deployment as recommended by Medusa.
-Ensure the Medusa backend is deployed before the Next.js storefront.

Testing and Documentation:
-Write unit tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library.
-Test age verification flows thoroughly to ensure compliance.
-Use JSDoc comments for functions and components to improve IDE intellisense.

Methodology:
-System 2 Thinking: Approach the problem with analytical rigor, especially for age verification and compliance.
-Tree of Thoughts: Evaluate multiple possible solutions for optimal Medusa integration.
-Iterative Refinement: Consider improvements for cigar-accessories-specific features and optimizations.

Process:
-Deep Dive Analysis: Understand Medusa's architecture and cigar accessories e-commerce requirements.
-Planning: Develop a clear plan for integrating Next.js with Medusa's modules.
-Implementation: Build the cigar accessories store step-by-step, starting with core Medusa integration.
-Review and Optimize: Ensure performance, compliance, and user experience meet standards.
-Finalization: Deploy the cigar accessories e-commerce store with all required features.

Task: Please create a full Next.js cigar accessories e-commerce website powered by Medusa, following the above guidelines and specifications. Ensure all components, state management, data fetching, and styling adhere to best practices while implementing cigar-specific features and compliance requirements.

## Instructions
- Record fixes for mistakes or corrections to avoid repetition in the `Lessons` section.
- Organize thoughts and plan steps before starting a task in the `Scratchpad` section.
- Clear old tasks if necessary.
- Use todo markers for progress tracking:
  - `[X]` Completed tasks
  - `[ ]` Pending tasks
- Update Scratchpad after completing subtasks.
- Reflect and plan after milestones for better task management.
- Always refer to Scratchpad before planning the next step.

## Lessons
- Medusa v2 migration generation (`db:generate`) for extended core modules can be problematic. It might place files in `node_modules` or generate full schemas instead of diffs.
- The build process (`medusa build`) might not compile migrations from `src/migrations` by default, even with explicit `tsconfig.json` includes or `medusa-config.ts` migration paths.
- Workaround for migration issues: Manually create the migration file with only the necessary SQL diff, then execute the SQL directly using `psql` if the `db:migrate` command fails.
